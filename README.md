# Basic Theme

Basic Theme is a very simple theme used to demonstrate unit testing in a WordPress environment. The theme has been written for Envato's Tuts+ Network and relies on the following projects

* [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit) by Sebastian Bergmann
* [WordPress-Tests](http://unit-test.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/). Note that `WordPress-Tests` are already included with this plugin.


## Installation

Note that this theme is not in development. It serves as a demo for the companion article.

1. Clone the repository or extract the archive to your `wp-content/themes` directory
